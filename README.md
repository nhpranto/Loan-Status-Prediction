# Loan Status Prediction
Overview

This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected using machine learning. It uses applicant financial and personal information to train a classification model and evaluate its performance.
The project is implemented in a single Jupyter Notebook and is easy to run and understand.

# Dataset

The dataset includes common loan application features such as:

Applicant income

Co-applicant income

Loan amount

Loan term

Credit history

Education

Employment status

Property area

# Target variable:

Loan_Status → Approved (Y) or Not Approved (N)

What This Project Does

Loads and explores the dataset

Cleans the data and handles missing values

Encodes categorical features

Trains a machine learning model

Evaluates model accuracy

Model Used

Logistic Regression (baseline classification model)

The model predicts loan approval based on applicant information.

# Results:

The model achieves good accuracy after preprocessing

Credit history is one of the most important factors for loan approval

# Tools & Libraries:

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook
